<h2>Team Projects</h2>
<strong>iPark</strong><span id="portfolio-links">[site](http://eyepark.herokuapp.com) | [code](https://github.com/nathanallen/iPark)</span>  
A platform for connecting people looking for parking with people hoping to monetize their unused parking spots. Built in one week by a team of three for our final project at Dev Bootcamp. We used Rails, the Google Maps API, jQuery autocomplete, and Bootstrap. All of these technologies were new to us. 

<strong>Practice Projects:</strong>  
* Real-time, multiplayer dice game built on Sinatra.

* Stackoverflow style message board for voting on lunch.

<h2>Side Projects</h2>
<strong>codeislike.com</strong><span id="portfolio-links">[site](/) | [code](https://github.com/nathanallen/nathanallen.github.io)</span>  
This site. No kidding. Built on Octopress, hosted on github, and tweaked extensively. It's baked not fried, so dynamic elements are done using javascript. Don't miss the easter egg, a [jQuery Selector Game](/blog/2013/11/04/jquery-selector-game/)!

<strong>brettallenmusic.com</strong><span id="portfolio-links">[site](http://app.brettallenmusic.com)</span>  
Simple ecommerce site for a self-publish sheet music business. Built on Sinatra using Bootstrap and WePay's embeddable shopping buttons. I cut my developer teeth on this site in 2011, and it gave me my first taste of CSS, HTML, and search analytics.

<h2>Additional Experience</h2>
<strong>Content Writer</strong>: As Communications Intern at the Columbus Idea Foundry I became thoroughly familiar with Wordpress, Google Analytics, and Mailchimp. My write-up of a wildly successful 3d-printing meetup was picked up by Makezine.com ([original article](http://columbusideafoundry.com/columbus-rocks-global-3d-printing-meetup-day/), [feature](http://makezine.com/2012/11/16/makes-first-international-maker-meetup-a-success/)). For more writing samples see my newsletters from [November](http://columbusideafoundry.com/nov-2012-newsletter/) and [December](http://columbusideafoundry.com/dec-2012-newsletter/) 2012.
