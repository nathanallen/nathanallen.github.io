<h2>Team Projects</h2>
<strong>iPark</strong><span id="portfolio-links">[<i class='fa fa-external-link'></i>](http://eyepark.herokuapp.com)</span>  
An airbnb inspired parking app. Built by a team of three for our final project at Dev Bootcamp. We used Rails, the Google Maps API, jQuery autocomplete, and Bootstrap. I implimented all aspects of search, from parsing search queries to autocomplete. [<i class='fa fa-code'></i>](https://github.com/nathanallen/iPark)

<strong>Meet in the Middle</strong><span id="portfolio-links">[<i class='fa fa-external-link'></i>](http://waneka.github.io/middle)</span>  
Won Best Overall App at DBC Alumni Hackathon 2013. An app that allows two people to find a convenient location halfway between them to meet up for coffee, drinks, or dinner. The app suggests venues, displays directions for both users, and can be used to send a link to directions. I integrated mapping based on two user locations.

<strong>Queer Quote</strong><span id="portfolio-links">[<i class='fa fa-external-link'></i>](http://queerquote.com/)</span>  
Won Second Place at non-profit benefit hackathon, Hack for Queer Youth. An interactive widget that syncs the audio from a podcast with text from a transcript. At any point during playback the current text or quote can be converted into an image and then shared to facebook. I redesigned our player to dynamically load and display stories and setup an API to convert transcript files to JSON. [<i class='fa fa-code'></i>](https://github.com/SamSamskies/Queer-Quote)

<h2>Side Projects</h2>
<strong>codeislike.com</strong><span id="portfolio-links">[<i class='fa fa-external-link'></i>](/)</span>  
This site. No kidding. Built on Octopress, hosted on github, and tweaked extensively. It's baked not fried, so dynamic elements are done using javascript. Don't miss the easter egg, a jQuery selector [game](/blog/2013/11/04/jquery-selector-game/)! I also created my own [API](/blog/2013/11/13/making-a-personal-api/).

<strong>wordplay</strong><span id="portfolio-links"> [<i class='fa fa-external-link'></i>](https://github.com/nathanallen/wordplay)</span>  
I'm fascinated with natural language processing. Most recently I coded an n-gram frequency counter and have been tweaking it to make it faster.

<strong>brettallenmusic.com</strong><span id="portfolio-links">[<i class='fa fa-external-link'></i>](http://app.brettallenmusic.com)</span>  
Simple ecommerce site for a self-publish sheet music business. Built on Sinatra using Bootstrap's responsive grid. The site integrates WePay's embeddable shopping buttons, soundcloud, and scribd. This site sparked my interest in web development back in 2011 and gave me my first taste of CSS, HTML, and search analytics.

<strong>srt2json.herokuapp.com</strong><span id="portfolio-links">[<i class='fa fa-external-link'></i>](http://srt2json.herokuapp.com/)</span>  
Convert srt transcript files to json via an api request. The api started as a simple workaround for a cross origin resource sharing conflict, allowing my team to access content by passing it through a proxy. I then realized I could combine both the request and the conversion all in one step. [<i class='fa fa-code'></i>](https://github.com/nathanallen/srt-to-json-api/)

<h2>Additional Experience</h2>
<strong>Content Writer</strong>: As Communications Intern at the Columbus Idea Foundry I became thoroughly familiar with Wordpress, Google Analytics, and Mailchimp. My write-up of a wildly successful 3d-printing meetup was picked up by Makezine.com ([original article](http://columbusideafoundry.com/columbus-rocks-global-3d-printing-meetup-day/), [feature](http://makezine.com/2012/11/16/makes-first-international-maker-meetup-a-success/)). For more writing samples see my newsletters from [November](http://columbusideafoundry.com/nov-2012-newsletter/) and [December](http://columbusideafoundry.com/dec-2012-newsletter/) 2012.
