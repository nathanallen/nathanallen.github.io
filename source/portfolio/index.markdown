<h2>Side Projects:</h2>
<strong>codeislike.com</strong><span id="portfolio-links">[<i class='fa fa-external-link'></i>](/)</span>  
This site. No kidding. Built on Octopress, hosted on github pages, and tweaked extensively. It's [baked, not fried](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000406), so dynamic elements are done using javascript. Don't miss the wacky easter egg, an early attempt at a [css selector game](/blog/2013/11/04/jquery-selector-game/) with a terrible UI! I also created my own [API](/blog/2013/11/13/making-a-personal-api/). [<i class='fa fa-code'></i>](https://github.com/nathanallen/nathanallen.github.io)

<strong>brettallenmusic.com</strong><span id="portfolio-links">[<i class='fa fa-external-link'></i>](http://brett-allen-music.appspot.com)</span>  
Lightweight ecommerce site for a self-publish sheet music business. This site sparked my interest in web development back in 2011 (then hosted on blogger) and gave me my first taste of CSS, HTML, and google analytics. It will be relaunching shortly on google app engine using stripe, bootstrap, and python google spreadsheets as a oneway datastore.

<h2>One-Offs & Hackathons:</h2>
<h4>Github Countdown</h4>
<a href="http://gitcountdown.herokuapp.com"><img src="/images/portfolio/gitcountdown.png"></a><br>
Don't break your streak! An international github countdown clock so you know how much time you have left to make today's commit. [<i class='fa fa-code'></i>](https://github.com/nathanallen/gitcountdown)

<h4>Full Movie Meter</h4>
<a href="http://fullmoviemeter.herokuapp.com"><img src="/images/portfolio/fullmovie.png"></a><br>
A mashup of /r/fullmoviesonyoutube and movie ratings Rotten Tomaotes, so you can find something good to watch online. 100% frontend javascript. [<i class='fa fa-code'></i>](https://github.com/nathanallen/fullmoviemeter)

<h4>Queer Quote</h4> 
<a href="http://queerquote.com/"><img src="/images/portfolio/queerquote.png"></a>
A javascript widget that syncs the audio from a podcast with text from a transcript (using soundcloud and popcorn.js). I created an API/proxy that converted .srt transcript files to JSON. My team won Second Place at non-profit benefit hackathon, Hack for Queer Youth. [<i class='fa fa-code'></i>](https://github.com/SamSamskies/Queer-Quote)

<h4>Meet in the Middle</h4> 
<a href="http://waneka.github.io/middle"><img src="/images/portfolio/middle.png"></a>
A simple javascript widget built with the Google Maps API that allows two people to find a convenient venue halfway between them, and display two sets of directions. My team won Best Overall App at DBC Alumni Hackathon 2013. [<i class='fa fa-code'></i>](https://github.com/waneka/middle)

<strong>StarterList</strong><span id="portfolio-links">[<i class='fa fa-external-link'></i>](https://github.com/nathanallen/starterlist)</span>  
Stalled pet-project to TDD a thick rails client (and learn some new toys like Cucumber and SendGrid). The idea was to make it dead simple to gather and distribute email addresses within a group *without the need for a formal organizer*.

<strong>Wordplay</strong><span id="portfolio-links"> [<i class='fa fa-external-link'></i>](https://github.com/nathanallen/wordplay)</span>  
I'm fascinated with the possibilities of natural language processing. Past ruby projects include a gibberish tweet generator that uses Markov probababilities, and one of my earliest efforts, an n-gram frequency counter.
