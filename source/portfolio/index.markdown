<h2>Github Countdown</h2>
<a href="http://gitcountdown.herokuapp.com"><img src="/images/portfolio/gitcountdown.png"></a><br>
Don't break your streak! A github countdown clock with timezone support so you know how much time is left to make a commit. [<i class='fa fa-code'></i>](https://github.com/nathanallen/gitcountdown)

<h2>Full Movie Meter</h2>
<a href="http://fullmoviemeter.herokuapp.com"><img src="/images/portfolio/fullmovie.png"></a><br>
A mashup of /r/fullmoviesonyoutube and movie ratings from Rotten Tomaotes, so you can find something good to watch online. [<i class='fa fa-code'></i>](https://github.com/nathanallen/fullmoviemeter)

<h2>iPark</h2>
<a href="http://eyepark.herokuapp.com"><img src="/images/portfolio/eyepark.png"></a>
An airbnb inspired parking app. Built by a team of three for our final project at Dev Bootcamp. We used Rails, the Google Maps API, jQuery autocomplete, and Bootstrap. I implimented all aspects of search, from parsing search queries to autocomplete. [<i class='fa fa-code'></i>](https://github.com/nathanallen/iPark)

<h2>Queer Quote</h2> 
<a href="http://queerquote.com/"><img src="/images/portfolio/queerquote.png"></a>
Won Second Place at non-profit benefit hackathon, Hack for Queer Youth. An interactive widget that syncs the audio from a podcast with text from a transcript. At any point during playback the current text or quote can be converted into an image and then shared to facebook. I redesigned our player to dynamically load and display stories and setup an API to convert transcript files to JSON. [<i class='fa fa-code'></i>](https://github.com/SamSamskies/Queer-Quote)

<h2>Meet in the Middle</h2> 
<a href="http://waneka.github.io/middle"><img src="/images/portfolio/middle.png"></a>
Won Best Overall App at DBC Alumni Hackathon 2013. An app that allows two people to find a convenient location halfway between them to meet up for coffee, drinks, or dinner. The app suggests venues, displays directions for both users, and can be used to send a link to directions. I integrated mapping based on two user locations.

<h2>Side Projects</h2>
<strong>codeislike.com</strong><span id="portfolio-links">[<i class='fa fa-external-link'></i>](/)</span>  
This site. No kidding. Built on Octopress, hosted on github pages, and tweaked extensively. It's baked not fried, so dynamic elements are done using javascript. Don't miss the easter egg, a jQuery selector [game](/blog/2013/11/04/jquery-selector-game/)! I also created my own [API](/blog/2013/11/13/making-a-personal-api/).

<strong>StarterList</strong><span id="portfolio-links">[<i class='fa fa-external-link'></i>](https://github.com/nathanallen/starterlist)</span>  
Pet-project to TDD a thick rails client (and learn some new toys like Cucumber and SendGrid). The idea is to make it dead simple to gather and distribute email addresses within a group *without the need for a formal organizer*.

<strong>Wordplay</strong><span id="portfolio-links"> [<i class='fa fa-external-link'></i>](https://github.com/nathanallen/wordplay)</span>  
I'm fascinated with natural language processing. Most recently I created a tweet generator that uses Markov probababilities. I also made my own n-gram frequency counter.

<strong>brettallenmusic.com</strong><span id="portfolio-links">[<i class='fa fa-external-link'></i>](http://app.brettallenmusic.com)</span>  
Simple ecommerce site for a self-publish sheet music business. Built on Sinatra using Bootstrap's responsive grid. The site integrates WePay's embeddable shopping buttons, soundcloud, and scribd. This site sparked my interest in web development back in 2011 and gave me my first taste of CSS, HTML, and search analytics.

<strong>srt2json.herokuapp.com</strong><span id="portfolio-links">[<i class='fa fa-external-link'></i>](http://srt2json.herokuapp.com/)</span>  
An api for converting srt transcript files to json. The api started as a simple workaround for a cross origin resource sharing conflict, allowing my team to access content by passing it through a proxy. I then realized I could combine both the request and the conversion all in one step. [<i class='fa fa-code'></i>](https://github.com/nathanallen/srt-to-json-api/)

* Designed a one-table database that stored both posts and nested comments.<span id="portfolio-links"> [<i class='fa fa-code'></i>](https://github.com/tiger-swallowtails-2013/gutoverflow)</span>   
* Created the javascript controllers for a Scooby Doo themed typeracer clone.<span id="portfolio-links"> [<i class='fa fa-code'></i>](https://github.com/tiger-swallowtails-2013/speedracer/)</span>  
* Bit.ly clone, craigslist clone, surveymonkey clone...<span id="portfolio-links"> [<i class='fa fa-code'></i>](https://github.com/nathanallen?tab=repositories)</span>
